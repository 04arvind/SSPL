    <h1>Jumbling - General Intelligence and Reasoning</h1>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>1. Introduction to Jumbling</h2>
        <p>Jumbling, also known as rearrangement, is a reasoning topic that involves arranging jumbled words, sentences, or paragraphs in a logical order to form a meaningful sequence. It tests the ability to understand coherence, grammar, and logical flow. Jumbling questions are common in competitive exams to assess analytical and language skills.</p>
        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Rearrange given elements (words, sentences, or paragraphs) to form a coherent and meaningful sequence.</p>
        <p><strong>Applications:</strong> Used in writing, editing, communication, and logical structuring of ideas.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. Types of Jumbling Questions</h2>
        <p>Jumbling questions can be classified based on the elements to be rearranged:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Word Jumbling:</strong> Rearrange words to form a meaningful sentence (e.g., is / book / this / a → This is a book).</li>
            <li><strong>Sentence Jumbling:</strong> Arrange sentences to form a coherent paragraph.</li>
            <li><strong>Paragraph Jumbling:</strong> Rearrange paragraphs to form a logical passage.</li>
            <li><strong>Mixed Jumbling:</strong> Combine words and sentences or involve additional clues (e.g., first word is “The”).</li>
            <li><strong>Coded Jumbling:</strong> Sentences or words are coded, and rearrangement follows specific rules.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>3. Key Concepts in Jumbling</h2>
        <p>Understanding the following concepts is essential for solving jumbling questions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Grammar Rules:</strong> Subject-verb-object structure, articles, prepositions.</li>
            <li><strong>Logical Flow:</strong> Chronological order, cause-effect, or thematic progression.</li>
            <li><strong>Connectors:</strong> Words like “therefore,” “however,” or pronouns linking sentences.</li>
            <li><strong>Context Clues:</strong> Keywords indicating sequence (e.g., “firstly,” “finally”).</li>
        </ul>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Element</th>
                <th>Role in Jumbling</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>

                <td>Often start sentences</td>

            <tr>
                <td>Connectors</td>
                <td>Link sentences logically</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Pronouns</td>

        <h2>4. Steps to Solve Jumbling Questions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Identify the type of jumbling (word, sentence, or paragraph).</li>
            <li>Look for grammatical clues (e.g., articles, verbs) or logical connectors.</li>
            <li>Determine the starting element (e.g., sentence with “The” or introductory idea).</li>
            <li>Arrange elements to ensure coherence and logical flow.</li>
            <li>Test the sequence by reading it to check for meaning.</li>
            <li>Verify against options (if multiple-choice) or recheck for errors.</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Example 1 (Word Jumbling):</strong> Arrange the words to form a meaningful sentence: is / book / this / a.</p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Identify parts: “this” (pronoun), “is” (verb), “a” (article), “book” (noun).</li>
                    <li>Standard sentence: Subject + Verb + Object.</li>
                    <li>“a” and “book” form “a book”; “this” is subject; “is” is verb.</li>
                    <li>Sequence: This is a book.</li>
                    <li>Answer: This is a book.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Example 2 (Sentence Jumbling):</strong> Arrange the sentences:
                <ul>
                    <li>A. She went to the market.</li>
                    <li>B. She bought some fruits.</li>
                    <li>C. She returned home.</li>
                    <li>D. She was hungry.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Logical flow: Cause → Action → Result.</li>
                    <li>D (hungry) is cause; A (market) and B (bought fruits) are actions; C (returned) is result.</li>
                    <li>Sequence: D, A, B, C (She was hungry. She went to the market. She bought some fruits. She returned home).</li>
                    <li>Answer: DABC.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Example 3 (Coded Jumbling):</strong> Arrange the sentences where first sentence starts with “The”:
                <ul>
                    <li>P. It was a sunny day.</li>
                    <li>Q. The team played well.</li>
                    <li>R. They won the match.</li>
                    <li>S. Fans cheered loudly.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Q starts with “The” → Q is first.</li>
                    <li>P (sunny day) sets context; R (won match) follows Q; S (cheered) is result.</li>
                    <li>Sequence: Q, P, R, S.</li>
