    <h1>Age Calculations</h1>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>1. What are Age Calculations?</h2>
        <p>Age calculation problems involve finding the ages of people based on relationships between their ages now, in the past, or in the future.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. Key Approach</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Represent ages using variables (e.g., let present age = x).</li>
            <li>Form equations based on given conditions.</li>
            <li>Solve linear or simultaneous equations.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>3. Example 1: Simple Age Problem</h2>
        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>A father is 3 times as old as his son. If the father is 36 years old, find the son’s age.</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Let son’s age = x.</li>
                <li>Father’s age = 3x = 36.</li>
                <li>x = 36 / 3 = 12.</li>
                <li><strong>Answer</strong>: Son’s age = 12 years.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>4. Example 2: Past Ages</h2>
        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>Five years ago, a mother was 4 times as old as her daughter. Now, the mother is 3 times as old. Find their present ages.</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Let daughter’s present age = x, mother’s = y.</li>
                <li>Five years ago: (y – 5) = 4(x – 5).</li>
                <li>Now: y = 3x.</li>
                <li>Solve: x = 15, y = 45.</li>
                <li><strong>Answer</strong>: Daughter = 15 years, Mother = 45 years.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>5. Example 3: Future Ages</h2>
        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>The sum of the ages of A and B is 50 years. In 10 years, A will be twice as old as B. Find their present ages.</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Let A’s age = x, B’s = y.</li>
                <li>x + y = 50.</li>
                <li>In 10 years: (x + 10) = 2(y + 10).</li>
                <li>Solve: x ≈ 36.67, y ≈ 13.33.</li>
                <li><strong>Answer</strong>: A ≈ 36.67 years, B ≈ 13.33 years.</li>

        <h2>6. Practice Problems</h2>
        <div class="practice">
            <ol>
                <li>A man is 5 times as old as his son, who is 8 years old. Find the man’s age.</li>
                <li>Two years ago, a father was 6 times as old as his son. Now, he is 5 times as old. Find their present ages.</li>
                <li>The sum of ages of X and Y is 60. Ten years ago, X was twice as old as Y. Find their ages.</li>
                <li>In 5 years, a mother will be 3 times as old as her son. Their age difference is 20 years. Find their ages.</li>
                <li>A’s age is twice B’s. In 8 years, A will be 1.5 times B’s age. Find their ages.</li>
